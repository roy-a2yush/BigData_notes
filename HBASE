HBASE

4 requirement of a database
	1> structured manner
	2> Random access
	3> Low latency
	4> ACID
		Atomicity: Either all should happen o none should happen
		Consistency: no constraints violated
		Isolation: locks
		Durability: no loss of data

HBASE: is a distributed database management system that runs on top of hadoop
	1> Structure: loose structure
	2> Low latency: real time access using row keys
	3> Random access: row keys
	4> ACID: Some transactions eil have ACID compliance

HBASE:
	1> quick searching
	2> quick processing
data stored in columnar manner
denormalization is preferred
join, group by, order by not supported.
only CRUD-Create Read Update Delete operations are supported
ACID compliant at row level
2dimensional data model in traditional databases, here 4-dimensional data model
	1> Row key
	2> Column family
	3> Column
	4> Timestamp
